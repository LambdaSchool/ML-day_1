I have long had an interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and the potential applications of these technologies.  I earned my BA in Linguistics in the 90s and have spent several years teaching ESL and working as a military linguist.  I think the applications of ML in the natural language processing space are broad and exciting, not only in terms of translation and things like sentiment analysis , but also potential applications in education and research.

Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?
I studied Math during school till Under Graduation days, but never realized its practical application till I came across Machine Learning.

Probability, Statistics and Linear Algebra were interesting during schooling and I even excelled during that time.
But without realizing how important they were in making day to day decisions.

Machine Learning is now giving me a new view on math and how it can be used to solve large variety of problems across domains like Self Driving Car, 
Determining Credit Fraud, Filtering Spam emails, Early detection of disease and so on.

In a country like India which produces lot of data mostly unorganized, determining a pattern and predicting the outcome can be game changer for initiatives both private and government.

Personally I am interested in implementing ML in getting changes to informal sectors like road safety.


What is exciting about ML? 
Being from technical background, I found learning ML using standard libraries in python was relatively faster.
This allows one to focus on finding the solutions needed to solve data in hand rather than worrying about the language intricacies.

What do you think the best job opportunities are in ML? 
There are vast applications of ML across domains and it shall grow over next decade.
But the jobs which excites me the most are the applications and services which can be built on top ML insights.

What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML? 
Solid ML basics and lot of hands on. This is one of the reason for choosing Lambda School since it is focusing from basics and hands on.

What dangers are there in studying ML? 
Application of ML shall matter a lot rather than studying ML.
"Don't be evil" the motto of Google is the best example for this question.

Are the moral or ethical considerations that you will be responsible for?
Yes, as a engineer modeling a ML, it would be ones moral responsibility to control its outcome.
Example if Self Driving Car fails due to ML modeling, it would be engineer's responsibility to own the failure.

Good example for this is when FB chat bots were taken off when it developed their own machine language.
OpenAI initiative from YC, Elon Musk and others is based on the moral and ethical considerations of not giving complete power to select few.

Machine learning is exciting because it allow us to draw insights, make predictions, or prescribe courses of action. It can be applied to any industry in about any situation. The possibilities are endless for machine learning and ultimately I'd like to use it to make a positive impact on a company as well as complete some personal projects to get some answers to questions I've had for a while.

The best job opportunities for machine learning, in my opinion, are those jobs that require the analysis of human behavior to understand purchasing patterns (I.E. amazon, netflix). The understanding of human behavior is probably the most important analysis you can do in predicting what type of product an individual will buy.

Employable technical skills: R, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS (web scraping), GIT, Various database systems (mongo, mysql, oracle),

Employable soft skills: analytical intuition - really understand the data, don't just blindly run models. artistry - for creating graphics.

There are a ton of dangers in studying ML, having a model to run and perform an operation automatically, learn and repeat can pose many risks to companies as well as customers. Moral and ethical considerations are also very important as a machine learning algorithm could segment customers unfairly.

The idea of technology excites me a lot. I have made difficult career choices to get in the field of software development (You can read more about it in the 'Optional Read' section). 

Currently, I am developing desktop applications. In my work, I come across so many situations where the problems can be easily solved using machine learning but I do not posses that knowledge yet and I feel disappointed. Thats how I moved towards understanding Machine learning. The exiting thing about Machine Learning is the fact that it has the capability to take away the hassle part of a task. For me Machine Learning will not just simply my life, it will also empower me with so much time that can be used to better and even bigger things. 

Currently, for machine learning I see the job opportunities almost in every field. According to me, the best among them are in the medical and automobile as we might enter in the the self driven vehicle era. The dangers in studying ML are as good as studying any technology, the responsibility of its usability resides with me and it resides with the choices I make. I do not like the idea of social media sucking into the data and not caring about privacy and I look at that as an ethical issue, for the same reason you will not find me on Facebook or Instagram. For me, an ideal company to work with could be a company that understands real human connections, that believes in a possibility of holding technology and compassion for human beings together.


Optional Read : A Little background on my career path.

I graduated as a civil engineer and about an year into my job, I started developing interest in programming. A month into learning 'C', I decided to quit my work as a civil engineer, went back to my parents house and started learning programming, I landed clients on websites like 'Elance'(now upwork) and developed a couple of websites for them. Later, I wanted to use this skillset in the construction industry and I struggled doing part time jobs to find a company that develops software for civil engineers. Later, I found myself at an interesting career path, I work with Structural Designing Consultancy, developing software for Structural Engineers. Today, once again I have that feeling of being stuck in a job that requires me to develop desktop based applications and I see that there is such a huge possibilty to make things better using ML/AI. I also do not want to bind myself with the idea of working with civil engineers only, as there is immense possibility to make things better. 

I have gathered all of the programming knowledge doing tutorials off the net or reading articles and this will be the first time that I will be part of class room like set up and I'm excited for it.

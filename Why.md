# Why do you want to learn Machine Learning ?

My background is in Capital Markets and Corporate Finance.

It is clear that we humans have a limitation to arrive to conclusions once the information we are trying to rationalize/process is larger than 3 dimensions.

When it comes to capital markets clearly there is huge potential to develop predictive algorithms where hundreds of features could be used to train supervised models and /or reinforced learning models to better fit actual market behavior. 
I do not imply that you would find a recipe to perfectly predict markets, however, to achieve  a level of statistical significance higher than what humans can do is completely possible. Associated to that is the fact that by using a model further improvements would be develop over time as domain knowledge growths.
The before mentioned ML application is already well underway and hundreds of financial institutions are quite advance in the development of such models.

In my view the real opportunity is in Corporate Finance.

Still today the main tool for analysis in a company is MS Excel. Furthermore even with the use of ERPs such as Oracle, silos exists in company where information is not fully integrated.

Financial analyst are not able to fully combine and compile data not to mention the the ability to manage models with large numbers of features. To certain degree this creates an arbitrage opportunity due to data asymmetry. 

My goal is to master Machine Learning in order to combine my domain knowledge in Corporate Finance to integrate data from different divisions of a company with the objective to better predict Sales behavior, better understand patters in clients behavior, as well as better predict the evolution of company financial results.

I know that my statement to certain extent involves stochastic analysis since any prediction about the future has an associated level of uncertainty.

Nevertheless, I think that by better using the existing data and extrating better conclusions from the existing data the statistical significance of conclusions could be enhance, hence, creating tools to design more effective corporate strategies.

A few years ago I found a couple apps that enabled me to use Python to manipulate things on my iPad. So I learned a bit of Python. Over the years I’ve slowly learned a little more. I’ve always  been into technology and even looked into a couple boot camps to do part time. I saw Lamba School’s ML mini-course and that it was Python centric, so I decided to give it a run. 

The most exciting part of ML that I’m excited for is the accuracy and out of the box thinking that is possible with ML. I’ve read that, in strategy games, the computer has used strategies that are unlike any used by humans to win. I think that’s really cool. 

One application that I’d like to see for ML is for endurance training. I’m an old, slow, fat cyclist. I’d love to see how machine learning can be used to ‘coach’ people to become the strongest cyclists they can be. While there is a lot of science behind cycling training, the cycling world is so steeped in tradition that I think giving a computer free reign to come up with training plans that might be different from what the best human minds have come up with, would be fascinating!

I don’t want to make this too long, so there you go!

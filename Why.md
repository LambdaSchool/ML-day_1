# HELLO! I'm Jessica.

# Question:
Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

# Answer:
One day, I was at Disneyland waiting for Star Tours (after the massive update to
reflect the changes from Star Wars VII). Their new droid animatronic was scanning
luggage for security purposes and I happened to be stopped in line next to it.

Not going to lie, this is what started my interest in robotics -- specifically animatronics.
The way the droid was programmed to have "expressions" (with small body tilts, its eyes popping
forward, etc.), that was all I needed. I was absolutely fascinated.

I've always enjoyed model building and started programming later in life (shortly around this revelation -
around 22?) by starting with Computer Science - C++ and Javascript. While I definitely
wanted to pursue robotics, I still had my other love of learning foreign languages which - at the time -
I didn't think was feasible with what I was doing with computer science. Then I found them:
natural language processing and computational linguistics.

So, why do I want to learn Machine Learning? I want to pursue my career interests in NLP and
computational linguistics. I'd still like to get involved in robotics, although my interest really
only lies in garnering humanistic expressions in robots.

And that's that. I'm sure there are more technical reasons out there, but this is what's driving me.

Thanks! And I'm looking forward to the rest of the mini boot camp :)

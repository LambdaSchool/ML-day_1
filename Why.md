## Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?
I believe it stands to be one of the most impactful branches of Computer Science. I also like math and computers, so it's a natrual fit for me.

## What is exciting about ML?
We finally have enough data moving about to make leaps in our collective knowledge, and as such more and more applications are being found.

## What do you think the best job opportunities are in ML?
For me--there is great work being done in physics at e.g. CERN using machine learning against the vast amounts of data being collected by scientists. Another area is in cosmology, where we can gather endless amounts of data from telescopes.

## What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML?
Much like other CS branches, "the proof is in the pudding". Projects and concrete applications that demonstrate mastery are always the best way.

## What dangers are there in studying ML?
Recently there is much concern about data security and privacy. More philosophically, the implications of general AI may be concerning. Practically, there's a lot of talk that this hype cycle is simply a bubble, and ML/AI will 'burst' within the next decade.

## Are there moral or ethical considerations that you will be responsible for?
Most certainly. Building models that will influence decision making always stands to be corruptible, or runs the risk of being disingenuous. Combined with the above dangers, there's an endless minefield of moral/ethical dilemmas ahead for ML.

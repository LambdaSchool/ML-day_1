Answer the following question: 

**Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?**

- I want to gain an understanding of the state of the art in ML and AI research (and where we are headed).
- I want to teach myself new skills, especially in computer science, math, and python programming.
- I want to learn how to better process, synthesize, present data, and arrange it in compelling narratives.
- Since I work in (commodity server) systems integration currently, I would like to understand better how customers are leveraging their computing systems.

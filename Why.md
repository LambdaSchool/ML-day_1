1. Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?
I am interested in Machine Learning for two major reasons. The first reason is that Machine Learning seems like a marriage of two career/educations paths I have taken in my life. During my college career, I studied economics and loved finding and analyzing data. After college, I began a career in web development and loved transforming bits of code into something visually appealing. From a very basic understanding, I believe that Machine Learning is a combination of the two with a lot more depth. 

Secondly, I want to have some knowledge of the world that my children will grow up in so that I can teach and prepare them for future opportunities.

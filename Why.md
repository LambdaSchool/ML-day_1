* Alright, boom. I absolutely beleive I grew up during the biggest age of technological development in the late 80s early 90s ushered in by, my favourite, IBM. As a child studying piano, I was floored whie watching MTV and IBM and Bosendorfer unveiled a 'self-playing' piano played by my hero Herbie Hancock. There was one video that basically recorded his playing and played it back with a fully automated piano and another in a later video that was capable of taking his input and creating a bot with similar playing style and articulation. *THIS WAS HUGE!* Seeing something like this was like seeing magic as a kid. I would literally dream about being able to learn this stuff and how cool it'd be to create something similiar on my own. 

* Fast forward until some... thousand years later that I found the video again, thank based algos god for youTube, and realize what exactly was going on.

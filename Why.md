**Super-short-silly-answer:** Everybody should learn ML

**Personal serious answer (as TLDR as I can):**
	Back in 2009 I decided to attend the International Conference on Computer Vision in Japan, Most of the attendants were phd or phd candidates, on the other hand, I was a mere cinematographer, despite that I've managed to make some great friends, and I realized that we all have a lot of things in common, for instance, a lot of them were inspired by the same movies as I did, it just so happened that at some point they decided to change the world, and this is where it gets crazy cool, because of the commonality of the tools/techniques involved, there was a lot of cross pollination; CS people that mutated into bio informatics that collaborated on genetics research, High energy physicists that got fed up and decided to change their game and became Quants, etc.. So after that, I got some books and decided to learn on the side, almost secretly, while I was pursuing my cinematography career.
	
	A couple of years ago I had an accident, that made me switch gears, I may no longer be able to follow that same path, however I can make my own, and I intend to do so with ML

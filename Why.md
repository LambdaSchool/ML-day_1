Why do I want to learn Machine Learning?

I think the advancements made in Machine Learning, and specifically Artificial Intelligence, are fascinating. The past few years have seen technology created that allows interaction between humans and machines to control household appliances, as well as dictate messages and ask for information. With self-driving cars being actualized and robotics taking on more jobs (such as flipping burgers), the possibilities for what can be done next seem to be endless.

My initiative in taking this mini ML course is not to prepare myself for entering the full or part time course, rather, I thought it would be an excellent chance to get an overview introduction of what is involved in working in the ML/AI field.

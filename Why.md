## Why do I want to learn Machine Learning?

I love Mathematics, I do enjoy analysing algorithms, and a huge amount of data is being dealt with ML everyday. 


I've been also focused on Web Development for a while and who hasn't realized how important ML has become?


I believe beginning a career in ML involves a lot of self-learning, both theory and practice. There are so many online courses and projects that can be added to Github and show who has put in the effort.


I've heard that startups expect more of this than work experience, so they could be an option to start after a full time year of learning.

Machine learning sparked my interest last year, when I met a software engineer who spoke highly about artificial intelligence and its impact in software engineering. I was interested enough to be fascinated by just how important ML was becoming when the engineer, Amede Deane, spoke of Sophia, the AI robot who was the first robot to gain a Saudi Arabian citizenship. 

When I attended a tech conference last weekend, one of the big talks on machine learning was on big data and the importance of diversifying it. Though machine learning seems to be a hot topic, training data enough to implement well is a major need. Big data's misuse in the criminal justice system on how it targets minorities for crime is a big topic in digital activism, and I am hoping that this course could begin to steer me in the right direction in writing more about it. 

What excites me about Machine Learning is that it can strengthen operations within within infrastructure such as the economy, healthcare, goverment, etc. The opportunies in learning a skill that is very valuable and fundamental in making better change is alot more than just entering the industry for me. I only want to learn this to fulfill a curiosity and to understand it on a different level. I plan to take the Google ML course after this.

>Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?


The ability to create models more accurate than linear regression and that can reason about high dimensional datasets has a large number of potential applications. Currently the best opportunities seem to be in the field of computer vision. For me to be successful in that field I will need a better understanding of data analysis and a portfolio of marketable examples.

ML could be dangerous in certain contexts because it may lead to many people relying heavily on a model that can't be understood by the person using it. Those who create these models will have to keep this in mind and will need to design systems in such a way that the intent of the system is communicated clearly.

##Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

my interest in data structures and algorithms made me to learn machine learning and i'm interested in learning and writing machine learning models that teach computers and make them to learn from data to make decisions or predictions through this the computer will be able to learn and identify patterns without being explicitly programmed to. That's why i choose to learn machine learning.

##What is exciting about ML?  

Machine learning as the name suggests, the machine learns from a given set of algorithms and intensive as well as extensive test cases and is a very interesting thing to learn especially when you can actually create something on your own and make it work. Hoping to build at least 2 to 3 ML applications in this bootcamp. What looks exciting to me is that there will be a day when machines(or to be more specific, robots) will be so advanced that they will become a part of people's  every day life. They will be able to do work like driving, cooking, and various other human-like activities.

##What do you think the best job opportunities are in ML? 

Today, when excessively huge amounts of data are being dealt with everyday, rather every moment, pattern recognition is something that helps large corporations and websites work magnificently with the users. Artificial intelligence has become a favourite with the customers, esp. intelligent personal assistants like Apple's Siri, Microsoft Cortana, etc. Under machine learning, as the name suggests, the machine learns from a given set of algorithms and intensive as well as extensive test cases. Based on user choices, the e-shopping sites or social networking sites display 'recommendations', which is all a part of machine learning, and is quite a revolution these days. So you definitely don't have to worry about the career choices. Most of the computer giants are working in this field. once i graduate successfully from this bootcamp i'm sure i will end up with a really good corporation. I can say the last sentence because i'm learning current cutting edge technologies from lambda school with successful machine learning instructors

##What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML?

As a beginner i first focus on building your machine learning fundamentals.after have a good basic structure i can  Build systems that have a 50ms SLA and take hundreds or thousands of transactions per second. Ideally, systems that are critical for a business to run. Play with some big datasets that are publicly available US Government Data. Learn how to be a great engineer since i have various programming backgrounds i'm not focusing only on a single language such as Python as many Machine Learning Engineers do. Instead, broaden my scope to include languages like Java, C++, Scala and JavaScript. I always look to take a role with a product-focused machine learning or personalization team.

## What dangers are there in studying ML? 

I'm sure we need to build performant machine learning models that need to be more efficient in predicting patterns and i can't think of other factors. on my research i found out the concept data privacy, “Fixed Actions Patterns.” as of now i'm sure about the dangers in ML. 

##Are the moral or ethical considerations that you will be responsible for?

while maling these smart systems we all need to have the responsibility to make sure that our society is not taking advantage of its most vulnerable member and the best way of doing this is to be part of scientific development and large-scale integration of these technologies.

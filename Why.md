*Why do I want to learn Machine Learning?*

My motivation is two-fold. I first learned the power of outsourcing tedious tasks to computers during my first engineering co-op at a manufacturing plant. I inherited an Access database that was built to automate reporting and help business unit managers make better decisions based on WIP throughout the plant. Prior to that system, one unlucky person had to manually run reports at 6 am and 6 pm. Computers are simply better/more efficient at crunching numbers.

Fast forward a few years and I had rejoined that manager at a different company doing similar work using similar tactics, and I realized that there was more data than I had the ability to sift through and draw meaningful conclusions. Given my mantra of "outsource to technology" I knew about machine learning and the theoretical ways in which we could deploy it to help us uncover patterns. However, my attempts at self-directed learning more sophisticated methods were unsuccessful.

So first, I simply want to get better -- and this is why I am excited about the Lambda School approach.

My second reason is a little more philosophical. I believe that building technology will continue to get increasingly easier. For example, platforms like Bubble and Appsheet make it possible to create commercial software with no code except for Excel-like logic. The same will continue within data science (e.g. BigML). 

As such, there is an enormous opportunity to leverage these abstractions, create value, and begin to close the economic disparities (and thus other social, second-order effects) that exist today. I look at ML/AI/DS and, more broadly, software development as vehicles of economic empowerment. It's a powerful toolset that I want to wield confidently to change the lives of those around me.

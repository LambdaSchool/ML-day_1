Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?
I have seen tons of data out in the biology and medical world just going to waste. Data that could save lives, data that could help people across the globe. The same is true with data from websites, so much of it is just going to waste because people do not understand the knowledge in the data. I want to develop methods and tools to have that data be able to communicate information at a higher level to people. In my honor thesis, I took two forms of data that was all public information and discovered possible new disease pathways for over 800 diseases, all from open data. That research helps other researchers find ways to prevent cancer and other diseases. I want to do the same but with more extensive more complex data sets. I want to convert raw data into information that people can use to move the world. 

What is exciting about ML? 
For me, the exciting part of ML is two-fold. One understanding the problem from the viewpoint of the data. Data has its own story and its problems so to interpret the data and be able to clean it up is exciting for me. Second, using dissimilar data sets, or data that is beyond humans able to understand it. Most people can make simple linear points prediction, to me that is no fun. However, to do a principal component analysis or some form of a multifactor dimensionality reduction to see how real data cluster together is sublime and very exciting. 

What do you think the best job opportunities are in ML? 
It depends on how you define best. For me, it is most challenging and most supportive jobs, are the jobs you want to stay late and work extra hard on. I think that vision classifiers (CNN) have a considerable job opportunities because we live in such a visual world. Also, I have a lot of experience in data management and content management of visual assets, which provides me a special understanding of visual data.  

What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML? 
I think Thomson had it correct, to be employable, you need to communicate that you can help solve the problems that the business has and deliver actionable information to people in an understandable way. Too often; people believe ML is man vs. machine. Where it should be more of people working with machines. When youâ€™re working with machines communication from the ML to the user and back is the key to make the system useable. People that can naturally communicate their ideas in a visual way that are clear and articulate will be employable.

What dangers are there in studying ML? 
For me, the dangers of studying ML is that I will not be successful. I have taken two other ML class; one was all math and stats proofs. I was joking with a friend and said, I wrote 50 pages of math proofs, and five lines of code. That is not what I want from this class. Another class I am enrolled in is all python programming with no videos and no support. They show you Tensor flow and numpy, and they want you to do x,y,z. However, if I have a question, there is no one I can talk to. So to me, wasting time and energy is always a big danger, because when I commit to something, I am 100% committed. 
Are the moral or ethical considerations that you will be responsible for?
My responsible is to work towards answering the question or finding information out from the data in an unbiased manner as possible while also remembering that everything we do, basis that results. I am a bit of an optimist at times; I think the world would be better with more machine learning, were machine help humans live longer, healthier lives. I know undoubtedly that ML will have some dangers and setbacks, all new technology does. I know that I use Nicomachean Ethics and professional ethics and focus on what is essential in the long run, that moral and ethical considerations will be minor.

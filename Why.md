## Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?
- I want to learn Machine Learning to strengthen my overall skills as a developer and aspiring computer scientist.

## What is exciting about ML?
- Machine Learning is exciting because it's still very young in terms of its societal integration. There are still a great many ways in which to innovate and contribute sunstantial work within the field.

## What do you think the best job opportunities are in ML?
- I'm personally thinking to be more geared towards things like data visualization, but autonomous vehicles and ML in Earth Science are very exciting. Creating a safer future and maybe even reversing some of the catosprophic damage humans have done to the planet in their short tenure are problems I'd be happy to work on every day.

## What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML?
- Strong fundamentals in calculus, linear algebra, and statistics
- The ability to learn and utilize new technologies quickly

(first 4 are stolen from developer tea, but highly relevant)
- Humility and Empathy
- Open-minded curiosity
- Grit of a scientist
- Expert-level communication skills
- The willingness to be a developer AND developer advocate

## What dangers are there in studying ML?
- One important one is algorithm bias due to improperly sourced data sets

## Are the moral or ethical considerations that you will be responsible for?
- I would say that due to the nature and weight that some of the models hold, and how readily companies tend implement them (without any sort of ethical regulation placed on them beforehand) it is LARGELY the responsibility of the ML Engineers to ALWAYS develop these systems with empathy.

- It should be the job of the government to regulate every single one that goes into practice. But we all know how that tends to go...

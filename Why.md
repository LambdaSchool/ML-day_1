# Why Do You Want To Learn Machine Learning?

In the near future, I imagine humans augmenting daily parts of their lives with machinery, like putting on a visual headset and gesture gloves to control their own special android who will go outside and run chores for them. Perhaps androids can partially think for themselves using machine learning, like avoiding passerbyâ€™s but still be under the control of a human being in the tasks they are performing and commutes they are embarking on. I would like to work as an engineer under this type of project eventually.

In the short-term, I want to create computer vision applications for entertainment that use the mobile video camera using "deep" (like you said, graphic cards haha) machine learning. 

## What Excites You About ML?

ML excites me because there is so many ways that the knowledge gained from a program like this can be applied. I expect to think differently when solving problems and creating algorithms, and instead of looking at a problem like "how can I solve this using programming", I expect to start asking "how can I create a model to deploy that will handle this"?

I truly believe we are just nearing the beginning of the type of problems that were, before lost to the human mind, and that now are problems that ML can solve. I am excited about meshing the human mind with ML learning models for better performance and quicker learning.

## Best Job Opportunities in ML?

The best job opportunities in ML are probably at established companies working on self-driving cars, autonomous drones or secret projects like IBM or Google or perhaps even vaporware startups like Faraday Future. I'm not completely sure on that yet though so I will do some research into that matter this afternoon.

## Making Yourself Employable in ML?

This is another thing I'm not completely sure about, but I assume that besides being able to design software systems as well as displaying your application of ML knowledge to projects and libraries shown on a viewable portfolio as you mentioned last night is part of it. Plus being able to do a bit of data science like creating data models and knowing bits of theory like linear regression and some advanced maths.

## Dangers in Studying ML + Moral and Ethic Considerations

Aside from constant clickbait by media publications about the "Dangers of AI", I think there are some true deep-founded considerations and fears when it comes to the dangers of studying ML and aiding machines in coming closer to sentience. I think it all starts in the ideology you apply to your work. If your belief is that machines are inherently superior and are created to replace facets of human life, then there are some serious dangers in the types of programs and inventions these people will end up creating.

Likewise, if your belief is that although machines are superior, they should be augmenting parts of human life and freeing humans from menial tasks like the Industrial Era did for us in the past, then there are less dangers to consider but still some moral and ethic flags being raised. 

If these menial tasks were previously the majority of the human population's identity (i.e. painting houses, delivering packages) how will humans reinvent themselves, or will they revert and regress back to earlier, simpler times like those that practice the Paleo diet?

The above is an elementary outlook on the complexity of working with & studying ML, but this is my general outlook so far as an observer and not a ML student.

## Responsibilities as a ML Student

Computing was never completely about machinery as much as it was about aiding humans in new, unfounded ways during the infancy stages of its development. The scientists working on these projects had read philosophy books like The Brown/Blue Books by Wittgenstein and various theorems that they brought with them in their ideologies while working on the earliest computers. Likewise, I believe that as a ML student we should research what problems we *can* solve using ML and what problems we *should* solve using ML.

So yeah, while I think knowing how to apply your knowledge as a student to computer systems, apis and architecture is important, I also believe that the singular, most vital part of being a ML Engineer or scientist is in how you use ML to solve problems and knowing when to step away from certain problems that would be better off left alone? Or something like that, idk.

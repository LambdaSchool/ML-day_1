## Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?
 > I want to study Machine Learning for a few reasons.
- __First__: I see it as an investment in myself and my education. Self improvement is a high priority to me.
- __Second__: It is a growing market with high potential. To add this to my current CS curriculum will only benefit me in my job search and keeping me competitive with the market.
- __Third__: I like challenges. Over the years I have been in numerous jobs where I realized there was little to no challenge. There was of course the initial challenge of learning my duties, but after that, it was limited growth. I could climb to the top of the ladder (and in fact did in my previous employment) but that would be it. That's not beneficial in any way unless my dream were to simply stay comfortable. No. I want to grow.
- __Fourth__: I love math. It has taking me years to realize it but I truly do enjoy math. Throughout my childhood life, while I enjoyed every bit of learning, math was one of my favorites. People would constantly make the same lame joke of "I'm never gonna use this in real life, why do I have to learn it?" I personally didn't care if I was or was not going to use it, it was fun to manipulate numbers to generate results. And to be able to be in a career where I __DO__ in fact use it is _amazing_ to say the least.

> Expanding the mind and creating the matrix: 
___
My knowledge in the field is currently limited to self-study. I look up to those with more experience in the area and aspire to improve myself and learn. I hope to contribute great things to society and the improvement of quality of life to everyone with these tools. Making a matrix of sorts to simplify and improve the way the human mind learns, making education more available to everyone who wants it would be amazing. I have been blessed with a middle ground of life, not starting at the bottom, but not at the top either. As a child I had to grow up early after my dad committed suicide when I was 7 years old. I learned what entrepreneurship was very early, always finding ways to make extra money to help my mom and step dad. Even now I push to one day own and operate multiple micro-businesses, maybe with a couple that have the potential to be sold in the near future. To employ what I learn in both CS and ML will only push me that much farther in the game in order to achieve other goals. Maybe this technology can be used to help build foster homes and orphanages. To clean water in areas that have never had it. To produce better quality goods for those in need. And of course, educate those who have never had the opportunity to learn.

My endgame is this:
* To learn and grow as a person, create multiple successful businesses for more than one source of income (ya' know, never put all your eggs in one basket sort of thing), and use cash overflow to improve society. I will first invest in myself and my education, which will allow me to invest in creating these dream micro-businesses, which will create the resources I need to build the orphanages I want to build, the animal shelters, the tools to create free, clean water for villages that have never had access to it, and better shelter, clothing and food for them as well. To see areas grow that have not experienced that yet. There are some particular areas here in the States that live in conditions people think only exist in third world countries. Our own people fail to see that some of these areas __ARE__ third wourld countries. I want to help fix within before expanding out. Start small, end big. 

That is my life goal, and why I want to expand my knowledge in these technologies.

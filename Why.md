# Welcome to my machine learning journey

# Why do I want to learn machine learning?

# I

I want to study ML as the subject matter sits at the intersection of the knowledge areas I enjoy learning about most. Astrophysics, Quantum Chemistry, Computational Biology, Neuroscience, Medical Applications, client services; all of which rely on software for consistent, reproducible results. I have been playing around with programming since I got a book from my teacher when I was 10 about C++, so my math intuition and logic has always been tied up with my programming circuits in my brain.

# I

I read papers and try to keep up with modern techniques on rendering and visualization, go through tutorials like Mike Ng's course to stay fresh but haven't built anything yet. I believe there are large spanning consequences of the wide adoption of powerful AI in everyday life, I want to be a part of those who can understand the inner workings of how technology is progressing on the cutting edge. Keeping knowledge widespread could reduce political, social, and economic concerns but it's already a ball rolling down the hill anyway. There are definitely ethical issues as well but I'd rather be on the front lines than on the side lines clueless.

I'm jumping on because I feel I could have an impact beyond myself that can't be measured, and it's fun stuff. I aim to educate and learn constantly with this and surrounding topics, I always love a good challenge. Getting ready with portfolio datasets immediately, have some ideas in mind. Since getting through the CompSci WebDev curriculum at Lambda, I want to build some ML in my portfolio with the web browser since I can whip up some nice React things and am working on Django. We shall see, needless to say I'm excited.

# Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

My day job is as a software engineer building cryptocurrency/blockchain
systems in Haskell. I love functional programming, and when I read Chris Olah's
post [Neural Networks, Types, and Functional
Programming](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/#fnref2)
connecting abstractions in functional programming and category theory to
different neural network structures I got hooked on machine learning too.
Unfortunately, the state of machine learning libraries in functional languages
like Haskell is not up to the same level of usability as e.g. for Python. After
playing around with a few Haskell Machine Learning libraries like
[hlearn](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/hlearn),
[grenade](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/grenade) and
[subhask](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/subhask), I decided that the best way
I could contribute would be to learn how people use Machine Learning in more
practical contexts and bring those lessons back to FP-land.

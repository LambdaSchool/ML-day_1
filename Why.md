# Why

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to learn machine learning because I have a skill for learning mathematics and I believe my vocation involves using this strength.
As you said in your lecture, 'machine learning is applied math', therefore I beleive my vocation to be or be closely related to machine learning.
What I find exciting about machine learning is that it is a new field, at the edge of human knowledge, that will change our every day world.
To make myself employable I need to be disciplined in learning, practice and I need to present and communicate my projects.
I don't know what to say for the moral and ethical considerations, except that I accept full responsibility and wish to be held completely accountable for everything I do.

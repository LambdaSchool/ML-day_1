Machine Learning is something I've always followed in the news and after reviewing the facts about all the benefits and possible considerations in AI I know we have barely touched the service on the industry today and I wan't to be a part of it. The best job opportunities are the ones that give you a sense of purpose and hopefully with the help of ML Engineers we can find solutions to real world problems we face today. 

To be employable in machine learning, being able to look at a big problem and piece together each problem piece by piece until you can get some sort of idea of what the solution needs to be. Patience is key and I do believe even though coding is a big part of the job being able to respect and talk with teammates is a key componnet. 

Dangers in AI are limitless and I do think we need to monitor them as they come but I do not expect things to get terminator unless AI is used in war like ways. Other than that I do not think of ML and AI as a bad thing, but something that will help our society move forward.

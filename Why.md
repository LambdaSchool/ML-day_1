I'm confident that the future can be better than the present. I want to learn machine learning so that I can contribute to making it so. 

While hunting for Jr. Web Dev positions I noticed that nearly every company has openings for Machine Learning and/or Data Engineers. After hundreds of rejections for web dev positions I decided that the market doesn't have much demand for the skills I currently have, and that I'll need to acquire different skills to be useful to civilization.

I've worked in various fields that collect interesting data but are currently unable to use it to make useful predictions. Making useful predictions from noisy data sets is very exciting.

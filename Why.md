Why do I want to learn Machine Learning? 

Thats a good question! I think to the proper way to explain it is how machine learning used today.

Machine Learning is used for more than just making predicitons it is also used in the medical feild to help doctors find tumors or cancer. coming from someone who from machine learning has had a tumor found and removed before anything major has happend was a belssing. If hadnt been for machine learning I could be dead at this very moment. Prior to finding out it was machine learning that saved my life I did a little programing like making websites and android games but since that brain surgry I have really looked into how machine learning works and how it is changing the world around for the better. We use it on a daily bassis but are hardly ever aware of it. Everthing from hospitles to google and linkedin use if for one purpose or another along with a lot of bussineses predicting how there bussines wil grow and what they need to change. The Reason I am wanting to learn machine learning is because of how much its helps people like look at all cars we got on the road today and take a look at the wrecks we have along with that due to texting and driving or drunk driving and in most cases just slight human error. Thousands of people are killed each year to that I know we are far from it but what if in the near future cars could take a drunk man home without having to worry about him crashing or if jenny could take her eyes off the road to text her best friend and not have to worry about crashing. Look at all the people who get misdiognosed and dieing because the doctor missed a slight place on or head or missed the start of cancer in her body. What if AI could see what we missed and help save thousands upon thousands of lives. I dont know no other to put it besides I want to learn Machine Learning to save lives!

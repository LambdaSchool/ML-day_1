Why I Want To Learn Machine Learning
			
      Jack Perry

  One reason I want to learn Machine Learning is because of the diversity that comes with the subject. I believe that every line of work imaginable could benefit with Machine Learning's abilities, whether it be for the employees or the produced material, perhaps both. With the ability to implement Machine Learning into a line of work comes a new way for people to embark on their passions and therefore truly never work a day in their life. I am a big advocate of entrepreneurism and having positive outcomes when working with/for others. Our time on Earth should not be spent working tediously, ineffectively, and long hours in a negative manner rather than doing what we love with the people we love. 

  Another great thing about Machine Learning is the ability to automate processes that will save others time and resources. With Machine Learning we can get so much more done effectively once we correctly teach the computer what to do. What a computer will do with the information that we feed to it is up for debate and controversy, but I would like to think that the right type of people, ethical people, will be the future Machine Learning programmers of today, and we will train the computers to do the right thing. 

  I personally believe that we as humans should constantly be learning something new. Not only does it help with our brain/knowledge growth, but it also allows us to keep relevant in what our interests are. I would bet that in the next couple of years many new Machine Learning techniques, methods, and programs will arise and it will be important to keep on top of the most effective ones. This will help us help our employers continue to grow, as well as make personal projects with the latest and greatest technology factored in. 

  I am very much looking forward to pursuing this new chapter of my life and socializing with my fellow programmers who are interested in Machine Learning. Together we can surely do great things!

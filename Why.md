I learned to program with Emacs Lisp and Clojure, Clojurescript. I love Lisps because they made it easier for me to program. I also found functional programming easier than imperative programming. However, I got stuck in a comfort zone, and my current learning goal is to get out of that comfort zone. Machine Learning is pretty far from the kind of thing I've done before - building CLI tools with Clojure and SPA's with Clojurescript.

In the last few weeks, I saw an interesting tweet from a thinker I'm interested in, David Chapman. He said that "Linear algebra is what we use for everything in the real world. Calculus is elegant, but youâ€™ll never actually have to solve an integral." That reminded me of a long lost memory from middle school math. We did a week or two of linear algebra - it was incredible, and short-lived, and I always wanted to go back and go deeper. Now that I'm an adult I can. :D

I think the things that I've seen as side effects of ML, that I'm aware of - especially book and music recommendations - are good and interesting.

Two things that excite me in the future, though, are:
  * Stronger Clojure ML toolkits. I love the Clojure language and community. Coding in Clojure + Lisps is much more enjoyable and powerful than other languages for me. There's some exciting work to bring the best ML methodologies and toolkits to Clojure. I know they need help, though.
  * Any application of any technology, including ML, to meditation. Meditation is a life-long interest of mine, and computers are starting to help us meditate. I hope to see + try + maybe even build the tools that explore this intersection.

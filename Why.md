## Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

My primary motivation is in fact sheer curiosity. I am especially interested in how to formally represent things that correspond to what we perceive as intelligent behavior in others. For example, when generating new text from an RNN that has learned to model the posterior probability distribution of words or characters in a sequence conditioned on the previous characters in that sequence, each new element of sequence is sampled from that distribution instead of always selecting the most likely one. On the other hand, in neural machine translation, search algorithms are often used to find the translated sequence which as a whole has maximal conditional probability given the input sequence. These then correspond to my interest in creative behavior - that is, whether the sampling/search strategy from a probability distribution can be engineered in such a way to produce what appears to be a creative product in some domain. This is just one of many questions that I am interested in knowing the answer to, and historically, with learning I tend to either see in what ways my questions are ill-posed, or find an existing solution, but right now I think it would be highly appealing for me to have a career in research; I think the first step in that is to learn as much as possible and then see if I am left with any questions that are both well-posed and unanswered.

Of course, I am also very excited by some advancements in industry, particularly in natural language processing and perception. I think that the current machine learning environment is unique, with huge crossover between academia and industry. The proliferation of highly competent, multidisciplinary experts in this field represents a rare opportunity for me to learn both theory and application from remarkable people. A cool application of a recent research development is only a stone's throw away, and I wish to take the time to sit down and build some things that I can be proud of.

To make myself more employable, I need to put time and effort into demonstrating what I know. Presentation is something that I have not given enough attention to, and I think especially in the context of producing a more informed society, it is not enough to move from one idea to the next without first packaging the important ones in a way that can benefit others. My formal education has developed my abilitiy to understand theory very much, so I see learning machine learning in a pragmatic, applied fashion as a perfect way to round out my capabilities, and gain engineering know-how.

In terms of ethical responsibilities, I do think that mastering any powerful technology should come with a realistic perspective of its risks, and knowledge of how to best practice one's discipline in a way that doesn't harm others. With machine learning, one particular problem I am aware of is that of creative models that reflect the biases present in their datasets. For this reason, debiasing techniques are of great importance to me. I also think it is prudent to read widely and consider many perspectives, learning how to assign likelihoods to different possible futures presented, and how to act rationally given this information.

My primary motivation for learning AI programming is to be able to explore new avenues for structuring social institutions. For instance our prevailing currency system are dated and inadequate for global markets. Profitability is almost the sole metric for determining normative standards and guiding courses of action. I believe an AI could be coupled to a crypto currency that would allow society to optimize monetary exchanges for happiness, sustainability, personal freedom, and so on rather than being strictly tethered to a system that often sacrifices these things for productivity and profitability. An AI could even help in determining the ideal properties for the unit currency in such a system. For instance, having a variable shelf-life on an exchange means could stimulate economic activity. Or perhaps large data sets of available goods and service could eliminate the need for an intermediate value store altogether. I'd like to elaborate on these ideas but I'm working with time constraints and from a mobile device. I hope this serves the purpose of the assignment.

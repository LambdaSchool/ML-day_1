I have been fascinated with 'how' computer software is created for many years. I have studied the origins of AI in learning the basics of Lisp/Clojure and watched many hours of SICP videos on MIT open [courseware.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/) I really love working interactively in Jupyter notebooks and I am really liking the new [colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) application from google.

I am currently studing Haskell using the IHaskell kernel with direction from the [Haskell-Book.](http://haskellbook.com/index.html)
 
I will have full time availability to study in the near future (November, 2018) without any need to work for an extended period of time.

Please consider me for your next ML course.

-Thanks Doug

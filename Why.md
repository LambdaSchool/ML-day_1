###Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

* Alright, boom. I absolutely beleive I grew up during the biggest age of technological development in the late 80s early 90s ushered in by, my favourite, IBM. As a child studying piano, I was *floored* whie watching MTV and IBM and Bosendorfer unveiled a 'self-playing' piano played by my hero Herbie Hancock. There was one video that basically recorded his playing and played it back with a fully automated piano and another in a later video that was capable of taking his input and creating a bot with similar playing style and articulation. *THIS WAS HUGE!* Seeing something like this was like seeing magic as a kid. I would literally dream about being able to learn this stuff and how cool it'd be to create/be a part of something similiar. 

* Fast forward until some... thousand years later that I found the video again, thank based algos god for youTube, and realize what exactly was going on. After several disected computers through the years, I figured out that it was a little deeper than just basic computer mechanics. It's the deeper learning that was teaching a bot to learn how to play like the player, or creating cars that could drive themselves, etc. I _instantly_ raided forums and everything to learn how and figured out what I had to do to get to that level. I learned python, i *CRAMMED MATH* until it ultimately became my grad degree, etc. I was prepped to the a MS in CS, but... for monetary reasons, now I'm at this step in Lambda trying to get started with this as well as finish my CS degree plan.

* This is the kind of thing I've been preparing for my whole life, whole time. To a point that I am fine with the sacrifice of a social life or whatever the case to advance.

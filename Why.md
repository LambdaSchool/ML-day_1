Teaching humans is frustrating because we are, as you hinted at with your DARPA project, difficult to understand. A big part of a teacher’s  job (and one of the more tedious) is trying to figure out whether your input (e.g. lesson plans, assignments, feedback…etc.) is producing the desired output (e.g. higher test scores, inquisitive active learners) for, in my case, over 125 students. Faced with little time and less pay, teachers often rely on heuristics as much as actual data to identify positive and negative patterns in their learners with predictably biased/lagged results.  My main reason for wanting to learn Machine Learning (ML) is I believe it can help educators see what works and doesn’t work in human education at a scale made possible by the internet and widespread computer access.

The general “learning” part of ML is incredible. To paraphrase Nate Silver, we are conditioned to see signals where they don’t exist (seeing what could be a tiger in the grass is safer – and probably more exciting - than just seeing grass), so a true test of what works is falsifiable prediction. Moreover, science is plagued by experiments that cannot be replicated partially because of the increased variability that comes with small sample sizes. ML is exciting because it essentially uses computers and the new abundance of data to tell the future (or at least be “less wrong” about it to quote another data scientist). From CEOs to a five year-old two days before his birthday (me), who hasn’t wanted to be able to that?

Beyond learning tasks, the output of ML in the realm of education is also thrilling. There is already educational software for kindergartners that adapts its lessons to not just their answers but also how long they spend on tasks, where they click or look to create a learning experience that suits the child’s preferred style. The Copenhagen Consensus Center has found evidence that early childhood education is, per dollar spent, one of the most effective ways to improve human welfare, but it is still hard to do because of the cost of good primary school teachers. Useful ML-enabled software, such as the example above, is still rare but has already been used to reduce that cost. Duolingo, Khan Academy, Bridge International and several other educational companies constantly post openings for ML engineers and data scientists as does the Department of Education. It is amazing to realize that instead being our replacement, ML has the ability upgrade us all.

And this upgrade is not one we can ignore. If we do not use ML to foster a smarter, more tech-savvy population, we will fall to the pitfalls of its evolution. In the longer-term this means greater inequality as only those with relatively rich parent will have access to education (e.g. good mathematics courses, computers) that gives them the “merit” to get hired to an ever more technical high-earning future job. ML-powered selection software for universities, jobs, or loans will, in turn, adapt to focus on the income of the parents to discriminate against applicants or even worse, such software will start to use skin color as a proxy in a world where parental income is often missing but there is strong negative correlation between darker skin and financial resources.

ML is dangerous in the short-term as well. The US military faces huge pressure in competition with the militaries of other data-rich societies to automate machines capable of killing people (i.e. drones). Tiny terminators sounds silly, but a swarm of small lethal robots without a human controller it is not a joke or a distant fantasy. It is all the more crucial that our drive to create more accurate ML algorithms does not trump the necessity of building ethical guidelines for their use. Math has no conscience. We do. I want to use both to make the median human better off.

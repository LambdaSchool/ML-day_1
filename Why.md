Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

Ultimately I want to be able to download and upload information to/from the brain. If I can help make that happen in my lifetime that would be a dream come true, if not then I can at least help in that direction.

I believe its going to take machine Learning's help to understand 100% of our neuroscience/biology. Machine Learning is the best way I can think of that will make Super Intelligence possible. I love fields/areas where learning is limitless and computer science, imo, is the best one.

With super intelligence I can help have the greatest potential for impacting our world bringing technology and nature into a synergetic balance that is positive for our world, people and everything else.

I always want to learn/know more and I believe the way sharpen that learning curve is through computers.

Ps if terminator happens then I'll be in a great position to help fight the good fight for humanity. :D

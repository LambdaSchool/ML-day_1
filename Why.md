Why do I want to learn Machine Learning?

Well, that's a convoluted question, isn't it?  Or maybe my response to it will be.  There are many reasons why I want to learn Machine Learning.  One of those reasons is because of my lifetime desire of wanting to work on/with robots, making them more efficient and productive so that I may utilize their abilities to help myself and others who need any kind of adaptive support.  Another reason is that I would like to help in finding better results for human-career choices, planning, and providing freedom from certain tedious tasks that prohibit humans from bettering their own lives and finding what truly drives their own passion in life without facing burnout or strain on time that could be used for personal enjoyment.  ML could achieve all of that amongst several other ideas I have.   I'm not all that fussed about job opportunities because...  

I have a goal and if I find a company with the same goal, then that would be amazing, otherwise, it might take me a long time to achieve all that I would like to do, which is one possible danger of studying the material... I suppose...?  There are certainly going to be moral considerations involved in how I apply any knowledge I gain from Machine Learning, but I am planning on using what I learn to help humans, so, I think I won't irk too many people with that.  However, if I have to jump into a job to sustain myself in the meantime, there will definitely be a lot of ethical questions that I will need to consider and I do not want those questions to hamper my ability to do the thing.

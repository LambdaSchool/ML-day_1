As infrastructure becomes cheaper and data easier to collect, I believe the paradigm has shifted to machine learning in a lot of areas in the industry.

I'd like to see patterns in the users' behavior and what causes them. For instance, if 20% of the users clicked on something, waited the same amount of time, and clicked on another thing, I'd like the model give me that information so I can infer information that could potentially improve the product, or give insights for better content delivery.

As a society, we haven't had a chance to consider the ethics of machine learning. For instance, if Russian propaganda was spread so effecively with such a small budget and a small group of people, what are the implications of millions of machine learned bot accounts plagueing social media? Whatever the future might hold, it seems inevitable that machine learning would be a part of it, and I'd like to be knowledgeable enough to be ready for that time.

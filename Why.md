What I find interesting about machine learning is that we could build systems that are flexible and 
adaptable enough in order to react to something that was not explicitly hard coded in the system. 
Maybe the machine won't be able to find the solution but it would get us close enough and allows us 
enough insight in order to facilitate discoveries that would benefit earth and all her inhabitants. 

I don't know what the best job opportunities are in ML, but I want to work in an area where
the results are helping people not just big corporations, for me this is not a zero sum game.

In order for me to succeed in the program and in securing employment in ML, I need to trust the program, 
the instructors, follow the directions given and learn on my own.
Expand on the knowledge given and create an online presence in order to showcase my abilities.

From the little I know, I would say the dangers of studying ML is that one should have properly established ethic guidelines.
If I keep in mind the fact that a tool that I work on can always be used for and against me then I could at least expect some sort of guidelines as far as respecting life.

I felt a huge amount of respect for the instructor Thomson Comer and Lambda School, when Thomson mentioned that he would not get paid until we start getting paid.
That is what Nassim Taleb calls "Skin in the game" it is a built in safety mechanism that spreads the risks among the student, the school and the instructor.
This is a moral/ethical model, the success of one is the success of the others.

Machine learning is very exciting because it is very useful, it has so many applications right now, and will have even more in the future as other fields of study and technologies evolve.
it has been the ability to learn what has always differentiated biological brains from computers, but machine learning enables computers to function (in theory) and learn similarly to a biological brain.
What is more interesting is that for some specific tasks, computers using machine learning are better/faster/more accurate than humans.
To become employable in machine learning requires a good amount of study as it includes many different topics and skills. Having the guidance of great teachers as the ones at Lambda School is very helpful in this process. After finishing this course at Lambda School, it wonâ€™t be a problem finding a job, as there is a lot of demand. Machine learning is a big enabler for innovation on products and services that help improve the lives of people around the world.

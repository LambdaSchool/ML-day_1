# Hello, my name is Kelvin

I want to learn Machine Learning because it is Mathematics in action. During my undergrad, I have taken many classes in pure 
and applied mathematics. I never really was interested in the pure aspect of mathematics as I found little to no practical
applications with it, whereas applied mathematics was much more practical. My passion for applied mathematics led me into machine learning.

I attended a session on AI/Machine Learning presented by Intel and was intrigued by how much statistics and calculus applications 
were involved. They were talking about Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. How the computer can recognize images based on 
a set of data and how it can also translate languages that it already recognizes based on it's pitch and tone. This presentation sparked
my interest in Machine Learning so I decided to pursue a career in it.

To make myself employable, I believe I'd need to gain a lot of practical experience with data cleaning, to do more projects and be able 
to present them to other technical/non-technical audience.

I think a few common moral/ethic issues that I would have to face are privacy issues. When certain data isn't available, we might need to
gather them ambiguously without direct consent from the person. An example would be browsing the internet. The NSA has been exposed of
having access to our computers at any given time through the internet to gather data which is a direct violation of our privacy. But doing
so would allow us to know who may be plotting the next terrorist attack and can possibly save millions of lives. Personally, I feel that
there is no right answer as of now but I hope there would be a better alternative in gathering such data without violating the privacy
of an individual or at least come to a certain agreement for their consent.

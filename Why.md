Machine learning is what got me back into coding and computer science. This new field has blown me away and I have a lot of ideas that I want to pursue. I am interested in biological data and there are open source datasources avaiailable such as the neuron maps released by The Allen Institute. I also love linguistics and have a deep interest in machine learning with text. These are the thing that brought me to  Machine Learning and Python and on Khans Academy brushing up on my math skills.

I'm honestly not sure about the job implications past knowing that there is work to be had. I've done some research on Google and it is an active field where demand beats supply so I don't have an reservations about the abilty to get work with the proper training but I don't know the full scope of possibilities. That's one of the exciting components to it. It's an entire new world that didn't exist on a practical level even 10 years ago, like you said in the lesson.

There are certainly going to be moral implications come about as a result of AI. It's not something I'm concerned about past it being a bridge that may need to be passed at some point. I can only imagine that will be a nice problem to have as it means I am doing significant work that affects the world.

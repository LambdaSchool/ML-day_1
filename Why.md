Why I want to learn Machine Learning:

Machine learning, and artificial intelligence in general, will increasingly be the major tools that will allow us to tackle complex problems and understand complex systems. It is hard to imagine that ML would not encompass nearly all areas of human endeavors, and so if software is eating the world, and ML seems to be in large part the future of software, I want to learn the skills to be a part of that and to contribute.

The other aspect of this is that the possible dangers of ML and AI in both unintentional consequences as well as misuse is as great as it’s promise for good, and I think more people who care about the moral and ethical implications of the use of powerful technology should take an active role in the field. We can’t simply say “I’m just an engineer” or blame the algorithm, especially if we apply those algorithms on large scale to system that affect millions of people in fundamental ways, so I am delighted to see you ask about this in this assignment. 

I'm most excited about the application of ML to improving existing and outdated system by producing better insights about their efficacy, as well as applying it in areas where the complexity is simply to great for us to get a clear view of the big picture such as in medicine, biology, and neuroscience in particular.

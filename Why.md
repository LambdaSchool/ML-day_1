`Why.md`

You must answer the following question:
Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

# I have a project that I'm really interested on working on in Machine Learning this summer. I'm going to be in the awkward phase between high school and college, where I'm not a high school student anymore, but not yet a college student. I thought it would be best to learn more about machine learning and give myself a little bit of a background before I fully dive into my project.  

The following questions are to help you plan your response, but specifically
addressing each question is not required.
What is exciting about ML?  What do you think the best job opportunities are in ML? What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML? What dangers are there in studying ML? Are the moral or ethical considerations that you will be responsible for?

# Machine Learning is broad in and of itself. You can teach machine how to do a task like you would a human (even though sometimes one might be better than the other on it. 

# There are a lot of opportunities in research, and it's going to be more important in all different kinds of industries: cars/autonomous vehicles, manufacturing, commerce, education, etc. 

# It's a big concern for most people that machines will outsmart humans, and it may very well be true one day. I don't think that is going to happen unless there's ill intent behind the data the machine/computer is give. If it's taught to fire off drones within a certain area and specifically target areas with the densest population, of course it's going to be evil. Evil is taught and learned. 

# There's moral and ethical quesitons to almost everything that humans do. Like the previous ecample, that's a giant ethical breach, especially when you're targeting civillians. What if you can't shut down the program and it goes berserk? You have to write ethical code and teach the machine with human decency and ethics in mind.

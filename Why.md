When I look forward into the future of industry and medicine, I can see how ML will play an integral 
role in helping professionals make better decisions. Innate to the process of writing ML argorithms 
is the necessity for clear and precise intention. The developer always has to ask himself/herself 
"What is my intension?" or "What am I trying to accomplish?" So often, professionals get lost in the
actions and chaos of their jobs that they forget what their actual purpose is. 

Here is a good story of illustrate my point. A neurologist, while in her residency, was making her rounds
in the stroke clinic. She took note from her superiors about the how long after a stroke she should wait to 
administer a specific medication. Some doctors said to wait this long, other doctors said to wait that long. 
Eventually, the young neurologist realized that nobody actually knew the optimal length of time to wait to
administer this drug. So she went on to create a bayesian algorithm to predict the probability of a patient
having an unfavorable outcome for drug administration after a set time point. The algorithm is one of the most useful 
predictors of rehemorraging, that many doctors use today. 

I think medicine will be one area that will see rediculous progress from machine learning. That doctor had no background
in math, programming, ML. She worked out the solution into a basic equation. I think about what could happen with all
the data collected from patients all over the world. Manipulating data is 100% non-invasive. Experimenting on people
or animals for a result that might be clear from the available data will become unacceptable. 

But someone may interject, "I don't want any of my personal data out there for people use! I'm very protective about my 
privacy!" To that person I would ask, "Well, do you own a credit card? Do you have a Facebook account? Have you ever 
in your life bought something on Amazon? Did you keep track of all the data you gave away?" The truth is, people are
too negligent or busy to care about every piece of personal data they give way. This data can be extremely useful if 
dealt with a collected carefully, but we also must be aware of the scale and the FACT that our own personal data
can be extremely useful to other people's lives. I really think machine learning will help people see their
own intentions more clearly. 

But for me, now, I just want to get ahead of the curve. Machine learning is going to be a valuable skill in any line
of work. If I start learning now, at 23, I'll be able to understand new applications and contribute to whatever 
line of work I choose to do as a career. I see it as a way to iteratively improve processes, whatever the processes
may be. I want to learn ML because the next 6 months are the BEGINNING of a lifetime of learning more about it. And I 
just love the intensity of this course.

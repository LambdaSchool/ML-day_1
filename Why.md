#Why do I want to learn Machine Learning.

Machine learning has always fascinated me, ever since I first became familiar with what
exactly it was.  There is so much mystery, and misunderstanding in the general public as to
what exactly machine learning is, I have to admit I was ignorant to many facets of ML.  

I knew that ML was used in a variety of ways, search algorithms, Watson, autonomous cars, etc.  
However, after a brown bag presentation at Lambda School where a gentleman was discussing how
ML is being used to detect diabetic eye disease, it became truly clear to me what an amazing tool
ML can be for humanity.  Diabetic retinopathy is the fastest growing cause of blindness.  Using ML
to detect this condition and help prevent blindness is so much more accurate than an ophthalmologist looking at eye scans. 

It got me thinking, how many other applications are there for this technology in healthcare, disease prevention, the whole array of human well-being.  

Software development is amazing, it can make so many aspects of life better.  ML takes this even further and being part of something that is so cutting edge, it's very exciting.

## Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

**TLDR: I am extremely interested in Machine Learning because I think it will change many facets of our society. I will describe a single field in which large improvements will be made by integrating ML--but which faces some ethical dangers from that same technology (or the abuse of it).**



_Imagine a world where machines can save your life._

After Serena Williams gave birth, she detailed a medical experience in which symptoms she expressed to her medical professional were overlooked--nearly leading to a potentially fatal situation. It sounds implausible: one of the most successful, famous and wealthy people on our planet, with access to some of the best medical resources. And yet.

The development of machine learning has implications across the spectrum of our society. For now, let's take a myopic look at the changes that could be made in our healthcare system. 

Machine learning can allow for more accurate diagnoses, noticing associations and subtle patterns that may elude even the best medical professionals. This will benefit not only the marginalized communities that often face doubt from their providers, but will greatly improve accuracy of diagnosing outlier cases that are frequently misdiagnosed by doctors.

It will also stand to level the playing field for many in economic poverty. Often times the best doctors take lucrative positions catering to wealthy patrons, while fewer and fewer private practices accept subsidized benefits. Machine learning can serve as one tool to expand access of quality services to people across income levels.

_Now imagine what insurance companies would do with that information_

It's vital to work with machine learning, and to do so quickly. Because with any new technology, there will be parties looking to exploit it.

People as individuals will benefit from early and accurate diagnoses, as well as even finding out to what diseases or conditions they might be susceptible or predisposed to develop. But what would happen to those same people if insurance companies used machine learning to determine which people are at a higher risk to insure for those exact same reasons? 

It is the responsibility of all of us to make sure that our society is not taking advantage of its most vulnerable members. And the best way of doing that is to be part of scientific development and large-scale integration of these technologies.

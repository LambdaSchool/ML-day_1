## _Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?_

_What is exciting about ML? What do you think the best job opportunities are
in ML? What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML? What
dangers are there in studying ML? Are the moral or ethical considerations that
you will be responsible for?_

I want to learn ML because I believe it's the future. I see the possibilities
of ML and AI in the everyday for consumers, businesses, and everyone
in-between. I remember my first time seeing a computer vision program
identifying different objects like pedestrians, animals, among other things.
And after this, I got really excited and my mind always wanders now with
ideas of personal drones, better VUI, business automation, and medical
applications. Personally, I don't know yet what industry I would want to work
in but I definitely want to work in AI more than data science (more `code`).
I want to learn ML because it's both cutting edge right now and will be the
solution to many of the world's problems tomorrow.

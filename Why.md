(I know you said specifically addressing each question is not required, but it's easier for me to write answers in this way)

1. Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?
- Since I was a kid, I've dreamt of building a machine that perfectly produces paperclips.
I'm kidding. I want to learn ML because I believe Andrew Ng is right when he says "AI is the new electricity."

2. What is exciting about ML?
Everything that has been electrified, will be cognified. Which means AI will be some sort of "5th Industrial Revolution".
That's an exciting thing. It's even more exciting to play a part in it. 
I don't know how I'll do it, but I think learning ML is a step in the right direction.

3. What do you think the best job opportunities are in ML?
- I've made a list of 100 AI startups (grabbed from CB Insights). They're all good opportunities (though surely most startups add AI to their name just for marketing/ funraising purposes).
Which company would I personally consider the best opportunities? Hmm... Well an easy answer are the two big ones that are chasing AGI (OpenAI and DeepMind). Also, any of the projects Andrew Ng is working on (Landing.ai or the AI Fund). 

4. What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML?
- Take the Lambda ML course
- Take Andrew Ng's full deeplearning.ai course
- Type at 120 WPM :)

5. What dangers are there in studying ML?
- This is a long answer. I very much follow the warnings of people like Stuart Russell, Eliezer Yudkowski, and Nick Bostrom. So I'd echo the alarms they're sounding. 

6. Are there moral or ethical considerations that you will be responsible for?
- See answer 5. And if I put the "robots taking over" fear aside, job displacement is a big big problem. I don't know the answers, but I'm looking forward to working on the solutions through getting involved in the field.

# Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

### Top Drivers for Change

In my opinion, the top drivers of change in the short to medium term future are: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in general, Automation and Robotics, 3D Printing, Mixed Reality, and Cryptocurrencies. Taken alone, any of these would have a sizeable impact on the world economy. Together, they can transform our physical world, how we communicate, how we transact business, even who (or what) we communicate and transact with.

Machine Learning has the potential to enhance the others and drive the personal productivity of every human to the point that it becomes almost effortless on our part. Imagine if everyone had their own "Jarvis" like Tony Stark in Iron Man. Imagine a robot "Baxter" in every home cooking, cleaning, and restocking the pantry. We are at a crossroads. One path leads to Star Wars' dystopian Empire, the other to Star Trek's idyllic Federation of Planets. Thankfully, even Star Trek isn't a pure utopia, so we can see that as a real possibility.

As I'm learning programming, I see the potential of a general AI that has good speech recognition to work with programmers and change the computer human interface from a keyboard to a conversation. "OK, Jarvis, we're putting together a feature for the Project Tracker we built yesterday using React. Wire it up and we'll call the main file 'Progress.js'. Oh, you're ready to go already? Great. We'll need to start by presenting a list of active projects to the user. What's that? You think we should use a map function? OK. Set it up - we can refactor later if we need to ..." It may not be conducive to working from a coffee shop, but it works well in a private space, say an office or an RV.

There are already projects working with AI to build software based on requirements without the input of software engineers, but I think that a human software architect working with an AI can build a better end product. I believe we should be building automation to work with humans to increase productivity, not totally replace human labor.

In the realm of self driving cars, I think we'll be safer and even more mobile once the majority of traffic is automated. It will signal a change in American society away from individual ownership of cars to a common fleet. That is a change that will be even more difficult to achieve than a gun ban. The pitfalls to self driving cars come when you have to program in collateral damage management. If you have limited control and are about to crash, do you save the life of the pedestrian at the loss of your passenger, or the other way around? How does that impact liability insurance payouts? Who makes that call, the manufacturer, the car owner, or legal precedent?

Uncle Bob Martin suggests that all programmers should take an oath similar to the Hippocratic oath taken by medical doctors. I agree. His logic (oversimplified) is that someday there will be a catastrophic failure that costs the lives of thousands of people. The cause will be traced to a piece of software that has a bug. The programmer responsible for programming the line of code that has the bug will be questioned about it. If his excuse is that the boss wanted it done "by Tuesday", he won't stand a chance of being treated fairly by the system. If he can point to an industry standard of ethics, review and testing processes, and management approval of all this, the insurance company will have to cover damages and everyone will go on about their lives. I agree with Uncle Bob. We need an oath. Especially in the development of Machine Learning and all the areas we see it managing in the future.

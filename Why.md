I want to learn machine learning because I believe it will have an outsized effect on the development of human society, and I want to participate in the changes it will bring.  While there are many industries that machine learning is expected to disrupt, I am most interested in its effect on the legal field and social media.  I have many concerns about the moral and ethical use of machine learning.  Already, we are experiencing the effects of machine learning in our lives.  It is being used to choose what content we view, what we buy, the length of prison sentences, and it may even have had an effect on the 2016 US presidential election.  I hope to participate in the discussion of how best to integrate this new and exciting technology into our lives in order to make us better and happier beings.

# Why do I want to learn Machine Learning?

## What is exciting about ML?

Personally, I was fascinated in seeing ML and DL being adopted virtually everywhere around me - digital voice assistants, predictive text analysis, sentiment analysis (the very first project I came across was IBM Watson that fascinated me so I researched this further), as well as I am seeing incredible applications in marketing, research, or eliminating menial labour. I am in a way trained to spot these business opportunities and think of how I can myself create products that will help others in a meaningful way.

Another exciting news for me is that Canada has made a commitment to invest significant resources to establish leadership in AI, and established three research institutes in Edmonton, Montreal and Toronto. I find it exciting that Canada is making an investment in this and actively works on promoting education and creating jobs in this area through the CIFAR institute and other avenues.

## What do you think the best job opportunities are in ML?

I have seen a small group of researchers in Slovakia working on classifying cancer tumors as well as Google's research in diabetic retinopathy. Although I am not particularly aiming for healthcare industry and would feel most confident in marketing or business strategy applications roles, I consider these jobs to be deeply meaningful and satisfying. I also deeply enjoy building and creating things (and breaking them apart) which, in part, I get to do as a business founder. I would definitely like to explore several avenues before making the decision.

## What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML?

Employability is simply demonstrating I can consistently create value for the organization I work for, in the form of work itself, extra projects, mentoring etc. To do this, I will start with creating a professional portfolio of projects as well as become more involved in the local communities of professionals with the same interest.

There is a growing community of ML specialists in Slovakia that is doing regular talks and demos on various ML topics which I used to attend last summer, although I haven't yet found a local alternative in Canada. I may need to start one :). This is how I will be looking for employment opportunities, as being a part of professional communities frequently led me to new job opportunities.

## What dangers are there in studying ML?

There is no danger in studying - there is danger in application of ML. I have seen a lot of evidence of bias and problems associated with lack of diversity, especially how ML algorithms frequently fail to meet the needs of people of colour. I have been a part of international communities my whole adult life and people from diverse groups are some of my closest friends, and for this reason I am committed to make sure I do not perpetuate these biases with my work.

## Are there moral or ethical considerations that you will be responsible for?

One of the highly surprising studies I recently came across was the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018), where most of the developers when questioned about ethics of their code answered that they ultimately blame upper management for it, shifting the responsibility upwards. My belief is that ethics begins first and foremost with personal accountability - for my code, my decisions, and the work I do.

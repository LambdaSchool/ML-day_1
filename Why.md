AI is the future. It's that buzzword that everyone now knows, that every industry is spending millions, if not billions, on. ML is exciting in that it can be applied to a vast array of problems. It seems like in the past, where we needed to design a new circuit board for problems or a new program, now we just need an ML architecture, some computing power and time. In a sense, it's the next thing that will take us into another world of possibilities with computers.

I work for an AI recruiter where we use ML models to predict certain attributes of engineers (at a very high/abstracted level). Talking to our ML engineer and hearing him explain the possibilities and efficiency vs human rating is indeed very exciting. Going back to my undergrad days, i remember taking a computational modeling class where we learned some python tricks and were introduced to the world of AI and ML. Since that class, I had always wanted to get involved, not only because it is arguably the most cutting-edge field to be a part of, but also because I want to be involved in making the space safe and available to the masses, not being run by a small group.

If I could do it over again, I would have studied CS with a focus on AI, since that was a track available at Oberlin. Ultimately, Lambda is the best way for me to get involved in the world and to make a difference.

It seems like the best jobs are centered around autonomous hardware, at least in terms of money. Pony.ai just had a 130 million Series A (that's crazy) and there are countless others like them. For me, institutions like OpenAI are the 'best' opportunities, at least for what i would want to do. Any sort of job where I can be a part of making the space safe, efficient, and accessible would be ideal.

As a philosophy major, I thought a lot about the moral/ethical dilemmas AI will invariably introduce as it continues to evolve. I think that's why the idea of safety and transparency are so important to me.

Suffice it to say, ML is an extremely interesting field that has and will continue to have a hand in how our future as a race evolves. Being a part of that movement, at a very important time in the field, is the most exciting thing I can think of doing right now.

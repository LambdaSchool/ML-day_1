I'd love to learn ML because it puts skin into the game of data science especially in fields like economics and finance.  When I was taking regression analysis classes in college, there was a ton of emphasis on extracting inferences from linear models.  While the study of inferences using things like p-values and t-values is important, there was almost zero emphasis on the practice of prediction using splits of data into training and testing sets - when that IS the principle activity on which their salaries are based! 

What draws me towards data science and machine learning is the idea of putting together models to produce predictions and being judged fundamentally by the quality of those predictions.  I understand that many processes in economics and finance are ruled by too much random noise to be able to apply i.e. classification models on, but the very idea that you ought to be judged on the quality of your predictions puts much needed skin into the game and will hold charlatans who work in the finance industry accountable for their actions.

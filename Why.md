`Why.md`

You must answer the following question:
Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

The following questions are to help you plan your response, but specifically
addressing each question is not required.
What is exciting about ML?  What do you think the best job opportunities are in ML? What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML? What dangers are there in studying ML? Are the moral or ethical considerations that you will be responsible for?

Machine learning is a means of answering a diverse spectrum of questions pertaining to an equally diverse spectrum of fields. These fields include medicine, psychology, social engineering, marketing, economics, finance to name a few. I already have intentions to implement the knowledge attained in this course in the cryptocurrency market, along with other algorithms that may turn out to effectively predict market trends as a means of refining my stock trading practices. The multiplicity of use cases for this technology is staggering and inspiring. That being said, I hope to use it in ways that improve the quality of my life, or the quality of life for humanity in general.

As far as job opportunities, I hypothesize any of the aforementioned fields are ripe with opportunity regarding this technology. Already, doctors are being ousted as diagnosticians by being outperformed by machine learning algorithms, and who knows the degree to which this field guides Wall Street and the financial sector in general; overall, I'd say this ability to decipher massive quantities of information will answer questions hitherto unanswerable by the human species. Considering the revelatory nature of this advancement, I imagine the actors in all disciplines - if they are even mildly cognizant of the implications of this development - will furiously attempt to recruit data scientists with this specialization just to remain relevant in the coming years.

There are a host of dangers one must keep tabs on in this sphere of knowledge. Information analysis mastery of this sort poises society to emulate the dystopian future depicted in the film 'Minority Report', and can certainly be abused by tyrannical institutions in terrible ways that require little imagination to cook up. The gravitas surrounding ML is not so different from the invention Oppenheimer incepted into the human project which evaporated some three hundred thousand humans. Sadly, the rate of technological progression is so astronomical that it isn't feasible for an ethical committee to address the ever sprawling ways that abuses can take place by those who wield this 21st century excalibur.

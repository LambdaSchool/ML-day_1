                          Why I want to learn Machine Learning

        For a significant portion of my life I had been interested in machine learning. I just hadn't realized it. Sometime in high-school I became interested in neuroscience. This pinkish, squishy, lump constantly sending electrical and chemical signals among billions of neurons resulting in amazing achievements that are easily taken for granted. The thing in our skull that gave us the ability to send and recieve words stored on magnetic disks from almost anywhere in the world almost instantly is incredible. I wanted to understand that. 
        With machine learning this way of problem solving is not just theoretical understanding. With machine learning we can implement these methods to solve real problems. Problems that would and have taken decades to solve through traditional formal logic. I want to be part of that. Whether I am accepted into this course or not, I will learn until I can problem solve through machine learning.
        I think neural networks hold the best job opportunities now and in the future. In my amateur opinion, knowledge of the diverse field of neural networks will be invaluable to know. Utilizing this knowledge to create fast and accurate ensemble CNNs will make that person very employable. From the few top scoring networks in image-net I looked into (and vaguely understood) they all seem to be some form of ensemble convolutional neural network. Being a machine learning engineer, like any engineering profession, is results oriented. 
        I would have to prove and communicate that I can solve the problem my employer wanted me to solve. I would have to stay up to date on the information in the machine learning industry to be able to pick the best method of solving the problem. Machine learning is one of the fastest changing industries. Being a machine learning engineer isn't the kind of job I can get trained once in and be fine for the rest of my career. If I don't keep learning I become obsolete fast. Machine learning being so new, I have to be confident enough to try and think up new models to solve problems when the current method doesn't work or isn't good enough. Cars not crashing only 99.7% of the time isn't acceptable, detecting cancer early only 98.4% isn't good enough.
        Training a couple hundred neurons to detect what digit is in a picture is something I don't have any moral qualms about. As neural nets get deeper, larger, and more organic we have to question the morality of what we are doing more. I don't know where we draw the line at something being advanced enough to warrent a consciousness. We have a functioning simulation of a simple worm of a couple thousand cells in 2018. With quantum computing breakthroughs of recent something closer to higher reasoning could be scarily close. On a less philosophical note, we have already seen machine learning used unethically for faking identity. I don't know a good solution to prevent machine learning to be used unethically. The best answer I can come up with is to collectively call out those who do bad. Not really machine learning specific, but machine learning can be used as a tool to do terrible things like anything else.

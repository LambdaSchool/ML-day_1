# My name is Amethyst O'Connell

I would like to learn Machine Learning so that I do not find myself unemployed in the new millenium. As a FIRST Robotics Alumni, I see what robots can do, and I see the possibilities, and I see myself being completely squashed by those possibilities if I don't take advantage of them. I don't want to be the horse driver at the dawn of the industrial revolution. I am young and I have years of my life ahead of me, and it is likely that my job, and everyones job someday, will be in machine learning in the next 30 years, or tangentially related.

I have quite a few ethical concerns, mainly, there are many people who can't even do algebra, let alone linear algebra, let alone machine learning. What is going to happen to those people, that are predominantly poor, and predominantly minority, that will be the horse drivers at the dawn of the industrial revolution. Perhaps I can prevent myself from becoming one, but in doing so, am I complicit in dooming others? It is absolutely terrifying how straight, white, rich, and male Silicon Valley is right now with the current trajectory of technology threatening to upheave everything as we know it, because without any social systems in place to protect non-technologists, if we as technologists don't take ethical care and responsibility, and currently we are not taking ethical care, nor responsibility, we'll bring on a new era of modern slavery and poverty. In machine learning, one of course must make sure that the datasets are representative so that the algorithms developed aren't obviously bigotted, but there's a greater responsibility we as technologists will have to take on to protect those whose livelihoods are lost to our innovations. Machine Learning algorithms need neither food, nor sleep, nor housing. They don't unionise, or vote. They have no children to love and nurture. We must take care to protect those who do.

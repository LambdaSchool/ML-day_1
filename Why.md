**Why Do I Want To Learn Machine Learning?**

While working on my graduate research on public acceptance of medical drones - those carrying medical fluids,
I began to realize that the landscape of tomorrow had already shifted more radically than ever imagined.
"Drones" in their most primitive interpretations are mindless zombies designed to fulfill a mission, but the
next iteration of that concept in my mind was the drone that, given a sub field, could be a proactive instrument
in medical care. Imagine an AED drone that could proactively be deployed in an area given area health statistics,
biofeedback from watches on the hands of patients within an area radius giving vital (literally) information
about the patient's heart condition, and that can incorporate global health information to fine tune the AED shock
it could provide to a patient suffering from cardiac arrest? This ALL was science fiction in the past, and 
to some today, still remains science fiction, but not to me. 

I'm interested in machine learning because, on a philosophical level, it is the next frontier of humanity. The strength 
of a machine being able to predict certain occurrences at this very early stage of machine learning, where practical 
applications to large problems have not been conducted, offers beyond significant abilities to preserve life. 
ML job opportunities in the nexus of life saving fields may take a couple more years to develop
but I feel it will be there soon enough. I want to be that medium through which mass positive impact for humanity can
be made.

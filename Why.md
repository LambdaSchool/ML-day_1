I decided to answer a few of the questions posed at the end of the first day markdown file. 

There are many things that are exciting to me about AI, but the one that I am most excited about is self-driving cars. My son is on the spectrum and the odds that he will drive himself are long. My wife also hates driving and looks forward to the day when she can get in the car and not have to do anything. It will likely take many more years and many smart engineers to work through the problems that will continue to arise before they become commonplace.

The job opportunities and employability question is one that is entertwined; the stronger your credentials the more job opportunities will become available. The better I do at Lambda School, the better my job opportunities will become. 

The question of ethical and moral responsiblity is one that I think about often; having read Weapons of Math Destruction, I have seen some of the ways these algorithms can be used to sometimes nefarious ends.

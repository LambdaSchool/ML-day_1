Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?
I have a Phd in computer science, but after that I moved to Industry. Because I want to see in practice what I'am doing and let other people
Use it to make their lives easy. And so this is why I want to learn Machine Learning, because we can use it to help other people 
(For example in Health Care).
What also love about ML and DataScience in general is that getting a job in this field will open more challenges every time. I mean that as
a DataScientist (using also ML) I'll be every day facing new challenges, to improve projects and solve problems, and so I'll not be repeating
what I do each day of my life.

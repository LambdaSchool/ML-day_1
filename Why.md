### Q: Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

Machine learning is an area where my interests and competencies are closely aligned that would provide me with an opportunity to do impactful work. Seeing the recent growth in the field of applied Machine Learning and the growing market interest around these technologies, I feel more motivated to learn than ever.

The story of me and Machine Learning is a loves story several years in the making. During my undergraduate studies, I remember reading about Neural Networks that wrote uncanny descriptions and rules for Magic: The Gathering cards or could play Super Mario. I thought that these things were amazing, but completely beyond my understanding. 

Coincidentally, at the same time I was studying Mechanical Engineering and had found myself deeply interested in the application of linear algebra and computational methods to model complex mechanical systems. Not realizing the overlap between the two areas, I took a numerous elective courses in computer science, computational methods, higher math, and applied finite element analysis then set out to find work in computational thermodynamics. That last part didn’t go as well as I expected. It turns out my set of skills and interests weren’t as well aligned with Mechanical Engineering as I thought.

More recently I’ve been amazed at the wide range of applications that Machine Learning is being used in. From online recommendation systems to programs that can play complex strategical games better than humans and the nearing promise of self driving cars. I can’t think of a field that I would be more excited to work in.

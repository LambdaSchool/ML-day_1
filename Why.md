# Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

Every decade or so, there comes a wave, which fundamentally changes how we operate as species.
That is just the nature of evolution, especially true in tech.
* Personal Computers - 1985
* Internet - 1995
* SmartPhone/Mobile - 2005
* AI/ML - 2015

Machine Learning is going to creep into every aspect, of almost every task that needs to be performed on a regular basis.
<br>Large portions of the tasks we humans do, are repititive and mundane, and can potentially be automated by Machine Learning in the coming years.

* If you are a sales guy, can ML do the entire selling for you - NO, can ML analyze your clients' gigabytes of data and suggest points to optimize/improve your sales pitch - YES.
* If you are a doctor, can ML cure the patient by itself - NO, can ML go through patient's entire life's health record and assist you in recognizing symptoms of potential health risks - YES.
* If you are a lawer, can ML give legal advice by itself - NO, can ML absorb the legal contract you are looking at and highlight inconsistencies you might want to look in more depth - YES.

...and the list can go on, for every profession, every business or any task we perform on a daily basis.

That's why one should be learning Machine Learning.

**And why should one be doing that right now?**
<br>Because,
* majority of the world knew about web development in 2005, very few in 1995.
* majority of the world knew about mobile development in 2015, very few in 2005.

The catch is to pioneer the wave, and ride with it.
<br>And Machine Learning's wave is here.

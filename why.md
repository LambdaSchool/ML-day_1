# Why Machine Learning

I am going to keep it short and simple.
I believe, that if used correctly and carefully, Machine Learning will transform the way healthcare and other important entities function. With the age of quantum commputing falling on us we will be able to synthesize protiens, which will lead to curing cancer with higher success rates. It will alow us to SAVE LIVES whereas no other means is possible. I am incredibly excited to be in this youthful ML age, and play a role in its development.

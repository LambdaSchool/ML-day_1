I want to learn Machine Learning for the following reasons.
- Gain technical proficiency in a high growth area.
- Learn how to connect with technical people. 
- Weave new found technical skills with existing storytelling skills to create a name for myself.
- Work on intellectually rigorous problems. Engage in work that satisfies me. 
- Give back to the Lambda community.

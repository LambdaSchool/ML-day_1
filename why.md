Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is fascinating to me because of the the joy I get from teaching and problem solving. Machine learning has massive implications for robotics and AI development, the latter of which intrigues me the most! I always wanted to be a teacher after retired from whatever financial career I pursued, but in this job market, its not a way to sustain a well-off family. Macgine learning for me is fascinating in that you are creating algorithms that can evolve over time, similar to, but not exactly the same as, teaching a student. Ive already started courses on ML on Udemy and EdX, and I can honeslty say that nothing else has consumed me for the last 2 months more (my roommate showed me a video on YouTube, Mar/IO demonstrating a neural netowork in Super Mario and I’ve been hooked ever since.)

In terms of job prospects, I think analytics and AI engineering our the most fascinating jobs. Conveniently, they also pay very well. AI development is the most desireable in my opinion, again because of the evolving nature of some algorithms, being able to “teach” certain skills.

As discussed in yesterday’s livestream, showing off what algorithms I can create, as well as searching for novel solutions to problems, are key. Additonally, showcasing these abilities on a personal website, offering my portfolio for viewing, and having genuinely interesting algorithms and content are essential.

I think the main danger, or at least the major moral dilemma, wih studying machine learning is that, in essence, yiu are trying to develop your mental succesor. AI, and even basic algorithms, can compute and make meaning of data far quicker than humans can. That has massive implications for the job market, mainly because AI can outpace and outperform much of the work force, once at a significant level. Accepting that is my biggest moral dilemma, and I see it at the greatest “danger” for studying ML.

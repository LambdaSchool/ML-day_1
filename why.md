Why do you want to learn Machine Learning? What is exciting about ML?
    Machines have since a long time surpassed humanity's physical capabilities with cars, airplanes, factories, etc, as some mental capabilities with calculations, predictions and data management, but never so close into making a machine make their own decisions based on their own assessment. The idea of being part of the creation of something capable of a deeper understanding of anything it can explore, a machine that can learn from its mistakes by itself for it to later apply it's experience, the use of math as the structure to create intelligence, the impossibility of creating true randomness, this all seems to be somehow related to understanding life itself. I might be totally wrong too, but the idea of all of this amazes me to a probably naive vision of what true Artificial Intelligence is and how it's understanding might be related to the deepest mysteries of existence.

What do you think the best job opportunities are in ML?
    Anything related to the research and enhancement of current technologies related to Artificial Intelligence in the different industries and government.

What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML?
    I need to show that I am able and skillful not only in presentation skills but in my work, by showcasing evidence and achievements in a convincing, knowledgeable and confident way.

What dangers are there in studying ML? 
    I doubt there are any dangers in studying ML more than giving it your #1 priority and having to postpone some social events in order to improve your proficiency in the subject. The implications of learning ML may give alternatives of it's application in different manners, sadly the two reasons I can think the most are for war/control and profit.

Are the moral or ethical considerations that you will be responsible for?
    There are ethical/moral issues thar should be respected.

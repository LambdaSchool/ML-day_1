# Why do I want to learn Machine Learning?

To be honest, I am using this bootcamp to decide whether or not (or how)
I want to learn Machine Learning.

To put it simply, I'm interested in ML because I'd like to help build the future.

ML seems like a great opportunity across three vectors: economic value, impact, and
intellectual curiosity. Economically, it's hard to argue that ML won't be one of the most
valuable skills over the next decade. It's equally hard to argue that ML won't have a massive
impact on our lives, to the extent it hasn't already. Intellectually, ML opens the door to fascinating questions across design, ethics, and philosophy.

Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

I want to learn Machine Learning because of the significant benefits it will bring to the world.
Mastering Machine learning will simplify tasks, data handling, and computation in significant ways.
I look forward to developing my mind so that I will have a better understanding of life. I believe that if I can learn this field of study I will become a better citizen of the world. I will be able to be a more significant being myself. I whole-heartedly feel that is the main goal for everyone on this earth and maybe even perhaps in this universe.

# Welcome to Lambda School Machine Learning

1. What is Lambda School
  * Intensive training
  * 45 * 26 hours
  * 15 * 52 hours
  * Application over Theory
  * Educational models
2. Who am I
2. What is the Machine Learning Course
  * A wide spectrum of topics in ML, AI, and data science
  * A focus on personal presentation and knowledge
  * A ML framework for producing results for businesses
  * A set of skills to compete in the ML world
  * A set of demos to showcase those skills
3. What is Machine Learning (ML)
  * ML is applied mathematics
  * ML is using numerical techniques to produce hidden information
  * ML is making predictions on data too vast for a human to analyzE
  * ML is data intuition, preparation, and sharing
4. What will I be teaching during the ML course
  * High level ML syllabus discussion
  * Computer science
  * Personal presentations
  * Advanced computer operation in support of ML
5. What's the point of learning ML
  * In demand
  * Producing more results than before
  * Many big names say it is only going to get more important
6. How do we get started?

`Why.md`

You must answer the following question:

Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

I'm first and foremost interested in being apart of Lambda. My friends that have told me about Austen have been nothing but effusive about the opportunities. Being part of a school that is this revolutionary feels like a real honor. It feels like being part of the future of education. All the other firms that I know that have left Y Combinator have contributed tremendously to the tech ecosystem and society in general. I've been following YC for many years with tremendous awe and it would be a huge honor to learn from the foremost education startup.

I have been interested in AI since 1999 when I first learned about it through film.

The following questions are to help you plan your response, but specifically addressing each question is not required.

What is exciting about ML?

I am really enthused by making better business cases for opportunities a firm faces. I absolutely loved studying and emloying Econometrics in my career. I have been fascinated by employing ML technologies to continuously reduce error estimations.

What do you think the best job opportunities are in ML?

Locomotion is the opportunity that is most obvious to me. Having a background in Finance, I have thought of little ways firms could make use of ML. Developing auditing reports is multibillion dollar business that has a blue ocean of ML opportunities. identifying fraud using ML was something I contributed when I worked at the Big 4. I have also been involved with Sales and Trading operations and tremendous opportunities exist in both spaces. Both on research side and front & back office operations.

What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML?

I don't think I'm as technical in python as Lambda is making it seem. I think I need a better grasp of that language.

What dangers are there in studying ML?

I regect the question. No danger should be feared that comes from learning truth.

Costs can be felt from honing a skill that is not rewarded by the marketplace. An example of this might be any non-STEM degree. Even though a degree is costly in time and energy it isn't necessarily dangerous.

A Mary Shelly danger is not something that any practicionar of ML should fear because of its illogicalness. Danger or its more quantitized cousin risk can always be assessed and the assessment can always be refined through more study. No risk can be assessed to ML without a study of it.

Are the moral or ethical considerations that you will be responsible for?

Yes. I have been thinking lobbying activity in this space and many other rapidly developing fields should be engaged in by the practitioners at a much more thoughtful way. Regulations and laws don't write themselves so I see this as the only way to pursue ethical consideration to be applied to the space generally.

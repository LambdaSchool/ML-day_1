I want to learn ML because I want to be able to create applications that help people efficiently live thier lives. I recently withdrew from law school because I found most of the work to be repetitive and am convinced that ML will cover the majority of legal work in the future. I want to work on projects that are not simply repetitions of previous work or spewing facts on a piece of paper. Systems of information that are efficient and equitable in application should be the goals of a democracy so that we have an informed society.
